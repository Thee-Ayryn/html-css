        <h1>CSS Basics</h1>

        <p>This me taking my first step learning CSS. This is going to be a 45 minute tutorial on the basics of CSS.
             I hope to learn as much as I can. I know that it's not going to be easy but I'll give it my all. 
             By the way, if you ever want a nice course on HTML and CSS I kid you not Net Ninja is the YouTube channel for you. 
             Everything is very well-broken doen and easy to understand too.</p>

            <h2>CSS steps</h2>
            <p>The first step is to have a dummy HTML code on Visual Studio Code or any text editor of your choice.
                The next steps are obvious and easy- follow instructions as provided by the instructor on lesson 4 
                on Net Ninja's YouTube channel. After learning, you have to keep yourself upto speed with all the CSS
                commands. However, it is important to know that you don't have to grasp all the CSS commands.
                The most important thing is to understand the concepts.</p>
